		<p>
			Bear Grylls, widely known for his television series Man vs Wild. Gyrlls is also involved in a number of wilderness survival T.V. series in UK and US.
		</p>
		<p>
			It has been a history of celebs joining Bear for his shows. In each episode of Running Wild with Grylls, Bear bring a different celebrity along on his adventure. Even Ex-American president Barack Obama also did a guest appearance in hike through Exits glacier and discuss conservation as well as the impact change on the Alaska Wilderness.
		</p>
		<p>
			On 29 July, 2019 Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi was announced as a surprise guest for a special episode to be telecasted on 12 August, 2019 in 180 countries. This episode was shot in northern state of Uttarakhand in India and is meant to raise awareness regarding inclusiveness of economic growth and environment sustainability.
		</p>
		<p>
			PM Modi shot was for about 45 min and it was over 3 pm on Feb 14, almost 30 min before the Pulwama Attack – sources of Govt. said. The channel said that the episode was shot in Jim Corbett Park and Modi and T.V. host Grylls had to “make a raft and cross a jungle river together”. The sources said that PM’s SPA cover was at a safe distance just like US Special Service when Grylls was a series with Obama.
		</p>
		<p>
			While Supporter are going gaga finding the hidden adventurer in PM Modi, critics are busy poking fun at him. Opposition Congress, on the other hand slammed Modi for shooting on the day when 40 CRPF jawan were killed in a terror attack in Pulwama. PDP chief and former Jammu and Kashmir CM Mehbooba Mufti mocked PM Modi over the show. She said, <em>"At the risk of sounding repetitive, the PM surely is a pioneer in innovative PR skills that seem to strike a chord with every generation."</em>

			highlight issues related to environmental change. Modi, said: <em>“For years, I have lived among nature, in the mountains and the forests. These years have had a lasting impact on my life. So when I was asked about a special programme focussing on life beyond politics and that too in the midst of nature I was both intrigued and inclined to take part in it. For me, this show presents a great opportunity to showcase to the world India’s rich environmental heritage and stress on the importance of conversation and living in harmony with nature. It was a great experience spending time in the jungle once again, this time with Bear, who is blessed with indefatigable energy and quest to experience nature to its purest.”</em>
