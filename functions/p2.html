		Satanism And It's Misconceptions:
	</div>
	<div class="postpara">
		<p>
			One of the Nine Satanic Statements which were originally appeared in <em><b>'The Satanic Bible'</b></em> states, "Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification!"
		</p>
		<p>
			But, more often, Satanism is treated as a sign of threat and something which deals with the devil.
		</p>

		</div>
		<p>
			A Satanist is pictured as someone dressed in a black cloak and mask engaging in bizarre
			violent rituals involving the blood of dead animals and an inverted pentagram which they call sign of protection, etched onto the ground in chalk. At some point in this vision, Satan might even burst through the floor in a flurry of fire and bring an end to the world.
		</p>
		<p>
			All in all, a Satanist is not the sort of person you'll be calling up to have dinner with your mum anytime soon. But, those are the sorts of stereotypes that Ashley S. Palmer, a reverend of the Church of Satan, wants to debunk.
		</p>
		<p>
			Satanism has nothing to do with devil worship. The religion, founded just over 50 years ago by US author and musician Anton Sandor Lave, has much more to do with atheism and liberation ideals of the freedom to indulge, muddled together with a dash of Machiavellian pragmatism. â€œIf a guest in your lair annoys you, treat him cruelly and without mercy." says Satan, which is not wrong.
		</p>
		<p>
			Satanism is humanity's original religion. It is based upon the ancient religions that predated
			<em>Judaism</em> and <em>Christianity</em> for hundreds to thousands of years. Satanism also differs from other modern day religions in the fact that Satanism is based upon science. Everything of the occult can be explained scientifically. Unfortunately, Christianity has held humanity back dangerously in the areas of science, technology, understanding of the occult, and knowledge of the soul. Christianity has always been and is nothing more than a tool used to remove knowledge, especially spiritual knowledge.
		</p>
		<p>
			The one known as Satan created us and designed us. He intended to bring us knowledge and make us as the Gods, but he was prevented from doing so and cursed by some of the other Gods. We did not evolve naturally as opposed to animals who have overall better health and immunity. Satan wished to bring us to perfection, but some of the other Gods wanted us to be destroyed after the mission was over and since we were
			becoming an issue, they attempted to let us all drown in the flood.
