			It's raining outside, the thunderstorms and stormy rain combined seems like a horror movie. And the electricity supply is cut, the more horrible because with each lightning, my eyes are blinking. With every lightning, I feel like its afternoon and soon a dark night. With the same thoughts which always depress me, I can't live anymore. But it is just a span of life, a very short span... Sometimes the world in our head get so much loud and the only world visible to us, we cut ourselves from the outer world, which is real. But for us, our imaginary world is whole our universe. Its stormy rain outside...the only one...but for everyone it's different. For the lady who is sleeping now after her job, the rain doesn't matter because she is already tired with her job and now she just wants to sleep. What is troubling her is the cut electricity supply and noise of rain and the thunderstorms. For the farmer who today sow the cotton seeds in his field was happy when it started raining but now he is unhappy and submerged under tension, what if this stormy raining will be continued then it will take away those seeds from the ground. A little shower is beautiful but more will destroy him. The student whose exam on the head is completely unworried about the rain, because he just wants to study, study and study, in LED or in the torch, doesn't matter either. For the swans, this rainy night is all about romance and beautiful moments. For the old grandfather who is tired of reading the newspaper every day, this rain is to remember his better half who used to make hot pakoras (an Indian snack) and coffee for him in such a chill night. For the writer who is tired of writing about WorldCup news every day, this rain is to weave new poems for his lost lover. For the family whose home is made of raw bricks and soil, this rain is a devil. For the child who had taken shelter under a tree is a curse, which will decide if he will see his tomorrow or not. The outer atmosphere is same if compared absolutely but relatively it is an angel to one and a devil to another. To some the situation won't affect a bit, to some it will give beautiful memories and to some, it will end their all memories...

			Our life is so similar, some rains will not affect us a bit, some rains will cherish us and some rains will destroy us. Sometimes we will be too strong for some problems and too frail for another. Problem is not a problem. The time matters, the situation matters. Everything is not in our hand but after this night the sun will rise again. And so we need to understand, if this rain flew away your house then what will you do? Will you drop your tears in the same flood or focus on collecting your things and courage to move on and to situate on this land once again and live happily once again. Sun rises every day but our sun will arise only when, when we will let it rise. Our sun is in our hand. Sky will burst more rain but every time it will make you more strong and then one time will come when no wind, no rain will have the power to destroy you...you will be unbeatable. Have patience. Build the home once again, live once again, the bad is passed and worst is yet to come. Get up before the sun and dominate your life. It's not too late nor too early. Everything is in its own time. This too shall pass.
