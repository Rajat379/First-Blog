			FRIEND, a six letter word that add vibrancy to our lives, without which life can be quite dull and boring. Whether it’s toddler, teenager, a middle aged person, or an old person. Everyone needs true friends to live life to the fullest.
		</p>
		<p>
			Friendship is a divine bond which cannot be defined by a single phrase or a paragraph. We should appreciate this mutual relationship which is based on understanding and feeling. Not only sharing in joys, but sorrows as well it is one of the most precious gifts of life. To cherish this beautiful bond with all those non-biological siblings without whom we can’t even imagine our lives, first Sunday of august is celebrated as FRIENDSHIP DAY.
		</p>
		<p>There is no particular time when one will find true friend.</p>
		<p>Friendship is born at that moment, when one person says to another: ‘What! You too? I thought I was the only one.”</p>
		<p style="text-align:center;">-C.S Lewis.</p>
		<p>
		We all have those amazing people who make our lives thrilling. They are priceless gems, who will never ever leave us in any circumstances, even if the whole world is acting against us.
		</p>
		<p>
			What friends do for us cannot be described in words. From support to guidance and enjoyment, they give us everything. They cheer us when we feel low, travel for kilometers with us for shopping and indulge in various fun activities. We have the best time of our lives when we are with them. Nothing compares to the stomach ache we get from laughing with our best friends.
		</p>
		<p>
			You are lucky, if you have a crazy bunch of friends whose level of craziness matches yours all the way. Friendship is not our requirement, this is love which we never wish to loose accidentally .Here is a wonderful poem by Meraj
		</p>
		<p><em>
			FRIENSHIP is a network
<br>
			That needs:
<br>
			No recharge!
<br>
			No charging!
<br>
			No roaming!
<br>
			No validity!
<br>
			No activation!
<br>
			No signal problems!
<br>
			Just don’t switch off your heart!
<br><br></em>
			<b>HAPPY FRIENDSHIP DAY!</b>
