		Eat that frog
	</div>
	<div class="postpara">
		<p>
			Imagine, if there was a situation where you have to eat a frog every single day. Then Tracy who is CEO and consultant of many successful companies says that the best time to eat this frog will be early in the morning, right after you wake up. This is because eating a frog is a difficult task and if you can get it out of the way in the morning then you can spend rest of your day being more productive. The frog represent whatever important work you have, which need to be completed as soon as possible most of the time.
		</p>
		<p>
		 &emsp;&emsp;
		 We delay our most important work by pro-casting. We think we will do it later once we have more energy, may be in the second half of the day. All it does is it increases your stress and makes you unproductive. Another reason behind completing the task early in the morning is that one have the highest power in the morning and it decrease throughout the day and we can take the advantage of this and use our will power at its maximum to finish our work .You must have noticed that on completing an important task we feel relaxed and it boosts our confidence. This happens because our brain releases endorphins which makes us feel good and relaxed. Now in order to be more successful we need to take this process of completing a task and feeling relaxed as a positive addiction and make it a habit because completing an important task daily will make us feel good and also increase our confidence and self-esteem. The author has shown main practical ways to make this happen.

			So let them discuss one by one,
		</p>
		</div>

	<div class="postheading" style="margin-bottom:20px;">
		Principal 1---- Setting the table
	</div>
	<div class="postpara"><p>
		One of the most important reason why we don’t utilize our time properly and procrastinate is <em>confusion</em> and <em>lack of clarity</em>. For example, when I get confused about on which book should I make my next summary I get more distracted by other works and waste more time but for once I decide what will be my next summary then I utilize my time properly. Similarly if you want to use your time properly you need to be more clear about your goals and targets and to do this accurately you need to follow a seven step process.
	</p>
	</div>
	<div style="margin-left:5%;">
		<div class="postsubheading" >
			Step1) decide exactly what you want
	</div>
	<div class="postpara"><p>
		You should exactly decide what you want with your financial life, your health, your relationship and your social life and also be very clear about other important aspect of life - <em>your goal</em>. This way you can avoid wasting your time and hard work on things that are not important in the first place.
	</p>
	</div>
	<div class="postsubheading" >
		Step 2) think on paper
	</div>
	<div class="postpara"><p>
		Only 3% of the people write their goals on paper and this habit enhances the chances of completing your goals by 5% or 10%. Our brain is not very good at storing data but it is very good at creating new ideas and information so try to make a habit of writing all your important and creative idea down on the paper.
	</p>
	</div>
	<div class="postsubheading" >
		Step3) make deadlines
	</div>
	<div class="postpara"><p>
		After writing a goal, assigning a deadline to it is very important in order to complete the task, otherwise you will keep delaying it.
	</p>
	</div>
	<div class="postsubheading" >
		Step4) make a list
	</div>
	<div class="postpara"><p>
		Make a list of all the works which need to be done for achieving your goals.
	</p>
	</div>
	<div class="postsubheading" >
		Step5) organize the list and make plans
	</div>
	<div class="postpara"><p>
		After making the list of all the works which come in your mind, organize it properly and then make a single plan about how will you finish the work?
	</p>
	</div>
	<div class="postsubheading" >
		Step6) take action on your plans
	</div>
	<div class="postpara"><p>
		After making the plan take action immediately because an average plan with an execution is much better than a great plan with no execution. Do not think much about it just take action because at the end of the day only action will give you the result of your plan.
	</p>
	</div>
	<div class="postsubheading" >
		Step7) Resolve yourself to do think every day that moves you toward your goal
	</div>
	<div class="postpara"><p>
		Read books, learn from mentor, learn new skills which will help you complete your targets or at least do a little bit of work every day which will bring you one step closer towards your goal.
	</p>
	</div>
	</div>
	<div class="postheading" style="margin-bottom:20px;">
		Principal number 2 ---- Plan every day in advance with 6p formula
	</div>
	<div class="postpara">
		<p>
			Plan every day in advance with 6p formula which says proper prior planning prevents poor performance. Before starting a new work, just a few minutes of planning can save your lot of time and can make your work easier and help you complete your work faster. This is because having no plan can create a huge mess which will force us to procrastinate.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now let’s discuss about action how we should plan things in order to take action for. For this we have to make a list as we describe in earlier principals. Now we should make only four lists: the first list is the master list. In the master list you have to write your overarching goals and targets which you want to achieve in your life, starting your own company or going on a world tour etc. Now second is the monthly list in which you have to write which need to be done in a month, remember it should include at least one task which can help you complete one of the most important task from the master list.
		</p>
		<p>
			Third is the weekly list, in this you have to write all your tasks which you need to complete in a week, all the works which will help you to complete your monthly goals. And fourth is the last list in this you have to write all the tasks which you need to finish today, which will help you to complete a part of your weekly goal and if you include all your household works into this list like paying your bills, meeting friends, etc. you should always prepare your list in advance. For example, you should prepare your list for tomorrow tonight. Similarly prepare your weekly, monthly, yearly list in advance and if any change is required you can add them later.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="postheading" style="margin-bottom:20px;">
		Principal 3 ---- A B C D E technique
	</div>
	<div class="postpara">
		<p>
			We also waste time by doing something that need not to be done at all.	</p>
		<p>
			A B C D E is very simple and effective priority technique which ensure that we utilize our time effectively after making the list. The next step will be to mark every task with one of the alphabet. Mark all your important work under alphabets A, if it won’t get completed you have to face serious consequences. Mark all the tasks less important than A under B and if you don’t complete them it will create some problems, mark all the tasks as C which would be good for you to complete but will not cause any problem if you don’t complete them. If any task can be done by someone else then you should mark it as D and any task is useless and its does not need to be completed you should marks it as E. after marking the work as per alphabets A B C D E then your priority will be completed. The tasks which are marked under A will be akin to eating the frog early in the morning. Now if there is more than one task which are marked under A, then you can divide them as A1, A2, A3, etc. where A1 has the more priority and so on.
