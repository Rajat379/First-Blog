		7 Life Changing Principle for Success
	</div>
	<div class="postheading">
			The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari – <span class="postpara">ROBIN SHARMA</span>
	</div>
	<div class="postpara">
		<p>Julian was a very successful lawyer who had earned so much fame and money in his life. He used to win cases of rich people so he used to be in the highlight of the newspaper. He had a big Mansion, a Ferrari, private plane and all the materialistic things one can dream of. But even after achieving all this he was never satisfied. His passion for name and fame grew so much that he started working for 18 hours a day & rarely takes off from his work. This behavior ruined his personal life, his wife divorced him. Even his family stopped talking to him. He started to look like 80-year-old just at the age of 53. </p>
		<p>
		 &emsp;&emsp; One day he got a heart attack while he was fighting a case in the courtroom. He got admitted to the hospital where the doctor told him to choose between his life and job. He got shocked, despite winning the biggest cases in court he lost in his own case of life. So, he decided to sell everything he had, his mansion, his jet, his Ferrari, etc., which shocked everyone. </p>
		 <p>
 		 &emsp;&emsp;
 		 Then he went on a tour to find answers to his some question, without telling anyone. This tour was to the MYSTICAL LAND of INDIA, where he went to HIMALAYAS because he got to know that he can get his answers from Indian monks who lived for hundreds of years with the energy of a young man, their knowledge and understanding comes in world’s Highest level of wisdom. They also have the power to liberate the potential of any soul, body & mind. The only problem was that nobody knows their exact location. He just knew that they live somewhere in the Himalayas. So, he puts everything on sake and started searching for them. After a long time, he gets to meets one of those special monks who took him to their village, where requested them to teach him their wisdom so he can live a fulfilled life. Seeing the desire of Julian, the leader monk gets ready to share their knowledge with him. They keep Julian as a guest in their village and then suddenly call him one fine day. They say they will only share their knowledge if he will share this knowledge with other persons too, to which Julian get agrees. </p>
		 <p>
			&emsp;&emsp; After this, the leader monk asks him to imagine that he is in a garden which is full of greenery and very beautiful. It has a nice fragrance & it is making him feel happy. Now, after seeing every corner of the garden he sees a lighthouse. As he moves toward it, suddenly he hears a loud sound when he starts moving toward the sound he sees a giant sumo wrestler, looking at him. He feels weird because he has only worn a Mawashi (a type of loincloth worn by a sumo wrestler) which is tied with a red wire. As the wrestler moves in the garden, he sees a golden watch. As he moves toward the watch, he got slipped and it looks like that he got died because he doesn’t make any movement and sound. But suddenly he gets a fragrance of a very beautiful flower, so he gets up and moves toward it. As he moves toward the flower, he sees a beautiful path which was full of diamond on both ends and this path leads him to happiness. </p>
			<p>
			 &emsp;&emsp;He found this story very weird and he requests the leader monk to explain him. The monk said don’t outlook the power of simplicity. I was thinking about a long time how can I easily teach you the knowledge and wisdom in a short time. So, I found it the best way. He said it isn't a normal story. It has a timeless principle for a great life. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="postheading">
		Those 7 principles are:
	</div>
	<div class="postsubheading">
		1) The Garden:
	</div>
	<div class="postpara"><p>
		&emsp;&emsp;In the starting of the story, there was a garden which symbolizes the brain. Because our brain is like a garden, in which if you sow good seeds, you will get great fruit and flower which will make feel happy. But if you will throw garbage in it that same garden will become home of sickness, similarly, if you will have good thought like kindness, empathy, respect and love these will make you happy more than any other. But if you will have a brain with negative thoughts like jealousy, anger, and hatred for others it will harm you more than any other. So, always have a mind with positivity. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="postsubheading">
		2) The Light House:
	</div>
	<div class="postpara"><p>
		&emsp;&emsp;  The lighthouse symbolizes the purpose, ambition, and goals of your lie. Just like the lighthouse helps the ship to reach their right destination. One needs the right goal and purpose in their life to reach the right position. For ex, even if we cover the eyes of the best archer, and moves his target without his knowledge chances are very less that he gets his target. Similarly, we should focus on our target so that they help us to achieve success and happiness.
	</div>
	<div class="postsubheading">
		3) Sumo Wrestler:
	</div>
	<div class="postpara"><p>
		&emsp;&emsp;   The sumo wrestler symbolizes Kaizen (a Japanese philosophy which represents continuous learning and improving oneself). Just like a sumo wrestler makes the continuous effort and be in the discipline to improve himself. Similarly, we should try to learn continuously and do activities which helps in improving our brain and body. Many people make excuses that they don’t have time, they are similar to that driver who is driving a car but refuses to fill fuel in it because he is busy in driving although he knows that his fuel will get empty in short term of time. So, don’t take a stupid short-term decision and improve yourself physically and mentally so that you can reach your destination successfully.
	</div>
	<div class="postsubheading">
		4) Cable Wire:
	</div>
	<div class="postpara"><p>
		&emsp;&emsp; It represents self-control and discipline. A cable wire has lots of thin wire from the inside, which on combining together make the wire stronger as iron. Similarly, small self-control, for ex eating healthy food instead of eating junk food, using stairs instead of the lift, reading a page of a good book instead of watching a useless video, etc. Although you will not find these small steps to be life changing but together all these steps will bring the biggest changes in your life. So, start making these small changes they will improve yourself control which is very necessary to live a happy and successful life.
	</div>
	<div class="postsubheading">
		5) Stop Watch:
	</div>
	<div class="postpara"><p>
		&emsp;&emsp;As you have guessed, it symbolizes time. Every human whether he is rich or poor gets equal 24 hours a day, neither a min less or more than others. The biggest difference between a successful and unsuccessful person is the way they utilize those 24 hours. An unsuccessful person doesn’t value his time, he procrastinates and wastes his time in other useless things while a successful person values his time the most and utilizes it very carefully. It doesn’t mean that he does work all 24 hours and doesn’t enjoy but the key he smartly utilizes his time which gives him results and happiness. </p>
	</div>

	<div class="postsubheading">
		6) The Fragrant Rose:
	</div>
	<div class="postpara"><p>
		&emsp;&emsp;The fragrant rose symbolizes one's nature of helping others without thinking about his own benefit. There is a famous saying in Chinese that “fragrances even remain in those hand who give the flower to others”. No matter how rich one gets, he will never be able to achieve that satisfaction which one get by helping others. That’s the most successful people help others to achieve their goal because it gives them real happiness and satisfaction in life. So, if you also want to be happy and satisfied, selflessly help others. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="postsubheading">
		7) Path of Diamonds:
	</div>
	<div class="postpara"><p>
		&emsp;&emsp;The last thing in the story was the path of diamond which symbolizes the present time of a person in which he is living. For ex there are many people who worry so much about their past and future that they forget to live their present. When they are in college, they think that they will enjoy in college. When they get in college, they think that they will be happy when they will get a job when they get a job, they think they enjoy when they will get retired. They never stop worrying about their entire life and remain unhappy for their entire life. Similarly, some think that they will be happy when they will get money, cars etc. But that’s not true money isn't a bad thing, one should work hard to earn it as it is essential for living. One should start enjoying his present and learn to be happy with what one has and work hard for what he wants.  Because in future you will realize that these small moment with your loved ones were the most important diamonds of your life which no amount of money can replace.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="conclusion">
		<em>These were the seven virtues of a monk for great success and happiness. So, just like the monk told Julián to spread this message to others, I also request you to share this with your friends so that they can also learn from this. </em>
