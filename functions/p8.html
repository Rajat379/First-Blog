		<p>
			Chandrayaan 2 a huge step in the field of space exploration. But why India need such a mission that cost approx. 978 crores to India. The answer is to study the nearest cosmic body of the earth our natural satellite the moon. It will increase our understanding of moon and space and motivate the upcoming generation to look forward brightly in this field.
		</p>
		<p>
			The objective for mission is to look after the space activities and it will also help in perfectly knowing of moon and its development in throughout times.one of important objective is to study further the evidence of the water molecules that were discovered by Chandrayaan 1. The yaan will land in the lunar south pole because the area here remain in shadow is much greater than the North Pole so there is probability of water. The solar system also have craters that are cold traps and contain a fossil record of early solar system.
		</p>
		<p>
			Chandrayaan 2 will attempt to land softly on the lander Vikram and rover Pragyan between two crater Manzinus C and Simepellus N. at a latitude about 70 degree south.
		</p>
		<p><b>
			1) First space mission to attempt soft landing on south polar region of the moon
<br>
			2) All technologies were hand grown
<br>
			3) 4th country ever to soft land on the lunar surface.
		</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			The launcher used for this mission will be India’s most powerful launcher till date<b> GSLV MK3</b>. Which is completely fabricated in India. The orbiter will observe the lunar surface and relay communication between earth and <b>Vikram lander</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Pragyan rover</b> is 6 wheeled robotic vehicle.it can travel 500 m and leverages solar energy for functioning.
