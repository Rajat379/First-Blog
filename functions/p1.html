			Rags.
			<br>
			Red eyes.
			<br>
			Scream.
				<br>
			Sudden rainfall.
	<br>
			Road side.
	<br>
			I was driving my car late at night, through the isolated highway,
	<br>
			Listening to the radio, I heard someone screaming.
	<br>	<br>


			Brakes.
	<br>
			Skid.
	<br>
			Shriek.
	<br>
			Stepped out.
	<br>
			Road side.
	<br>	<br>


			A chill ran down my spine as I heard whispering among the damp leaves,
	<br>
			My Jaws had dropped and my eyes were filled with a fog of disbelief.
	<br>	<br>


			Blood.
	<br>
			Blood.
	<br>
			Blood.
	<br>	<br>


			Was it blood or her red dress?
	<br>
			Her face had scars and legs were covered in mud.
	<br>
			As she dragged herself away from the roadside
	<br>
			A shiver swiped throughout my body.

	<br>	<br>

			I had seen the worst,
	<br>
			But I almost held my breath, as the worst was yet to come
	<br>
			I walked closer to her slowly,
	<br>
			Huh! OMG a rape again.

	<br>	<br>

			Hush.
	<br>
			Distant howl.
	<br>
			Sudden gust.
	<br>
			Again hush.
	<br>	<br>


			When I reached her,
	<br>
			She had tears in her eyes as blood poured from her body,
	<br>
			Leaning on the odd side, she sighed!
	<br>	<br>


			Tears.
	<br>
			Trauma.
	<br>
			Pain.
	<br>
			Blood.
	<br>
			Another victim.
	<br>
			Of sexual assault.
	<br>	<br>
