		How To Become Billionaire?
	</div>
	<div class="postheading">
		From Rich Dad Poor Dad – Robert Kiosk
	</div>
	<div class="postpara">
		<p>Hey friends today I am going to tell you a key for getting rich which deals with the fact that why only few people get really rich and why most of the people die living poor or middle class life.</p>
		<p>
			Let’s begin with a story of Robert who had two fathers. One had a PhD degree and other never finished his eighth grade. Both were very smart and hardworking but had very different points of views regarding success and they gave different teaching to Robert. One said that money is the roots of all evil while other said lack of money is the root of all evil. One always said we can’t afford expensive things while the other told Robert to find ways that how can he afford them, as that exercise the brain to come up with ideas. One told him to study hard and try to get a job in a big company while the other told him to study hard and try to open his own company and create jobs. Robert had an advantage as he had 2 dads and saw both of them grow from his childhood. He used his logic and followed his second dad’s advice who later became the richest man in Miami, Florida. And with his teaching Robert Kiosk himself became multi-millionaire, while his first dad kept on struggling financially throughout his life. One of the most important key for success which Robert got from his rich dad was financial literacy which is knowing the difference between <b><em>assets</em></b> and <b><em>liabilities</em></b>. He gave a really simple definition for them i.e. assets are anything which makes money for you and liabilities are thing which take money away from you. The reason rich people are rich because they acquire assets while the middle class just buy liabilities.
		</p>
		 <p>
			 E.g. There were two friends Bob and Bill, both working on a same post with same salary. As soon as they got their salary Bob used to go and buy stuffs like the latest cell phone, cool gadgets, branded clothes, shoes, bikes or thing like that which would make him feel good and rich but he failed to think that these were just liabilities. As they took his money away from him not just while buying them but also in the future for maintenance etc. and even kept losing its value with time and did not returned any profit. But Bill did not bought all the thing unless it is very necessary. He used to save money and spend it on assets like bonds, stock, real estate or in developing his own skills etc. which could generate income for him in future and make money. After 2 year Bill became millionaire while Bob kept on struggling financially and blamed his low salary for reason of his struggle.
		 </p>

		 <p>The cash flow of poor people goes something like this that they get income and then they have expenses which eats all their income. For middle class the income goes into expenditure and liabilities which they think are assets. Example, most of middle class people think that the house they own is their asset but that is not true as the house does not put money in their pocket or make money for them, it is just a liability unless they give it for rent. The rich class on the other hand spends their income to make assets which in return make money for them and they mostly spend expenditure from this income. So by doing this they continuously grow and keep getting rich as their source of income increases. If you really want to get rich, let this simple idea fit into your mind - <em>it’s not the amount you earn but the amount you keep makes you rich.</em>

				People keep on complaining that they should get better income which would improve their life but the problem is even if their income increases it will just increase their expenditure. As high income will make them desire to have a better house, better car, etc. which again are just liabilities that will keep them away from getting rich and make them struggle financially.
			</p>
			<p><em>So to conclude it’s not how much money you earn but how you spend it will make all the difference.</em></p>
			<p>These concepts were taken from <b>Robert Kiosk</b>, the author of <em>Rich Dad Poor Dad.</em></p>
